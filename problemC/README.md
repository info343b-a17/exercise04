# Problem C

In this exercise, you will learn to utilize the [**HTML5 Canvas**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) API in order programmatically create images. Visit the link or the below resources for tutorials and explanations of the API.

You will write JavaScript code to produce a picture of a old-school rocket ship:

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments. Note that you will _not_ need to edit the HTML file!

You can see the results of your work by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser. Remember to refresh the page after you update your code, and to check for any errors in the Developer console.

## Testing
This exercise includes a test suite to verify that the outputted content is correct. Note that this uses pixel-based image comparison of your drawn rocket (but in a much more robust way!) The test comparison works correctly on both Mac and Windows.

You can run the test suite using

```bash
jest problemC
```
