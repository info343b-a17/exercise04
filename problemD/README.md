# Problem D

In this exercise, you will continue practice with functional looping and working with arrays of objects.

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments.

You can see the results of your work either by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser and viewing the output in the [Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/), or by running the script directly using Node.js:

```bash
# from the problem1 directory
node js/index.js
```


## Testing
This exercise includes a test suite to verify that the outputted content is correct. Note that this test is simply to help you verify your results; it will not ensure that your code follows the required syntactical approach (e.g., that you used callback functions).

You can run the test suite using

```bash
jest problemD
```

Note that extraneous or missing logged output will cause the tests to fail.
